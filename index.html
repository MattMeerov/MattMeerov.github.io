             <p>Hello, my name is Matt, I am 25 years old. I was born in Russia on December 20, 1999 but moved to America in 2008. As a child, I was in the hospital a lot and I would spend my time there drawing nonstop. At some point that hospital wing was covered wall to wall with my drawings. Illustration has became both therapeutic and cathartic for me and has been a passion of mine ever since.</p>
             <p>My other passion is activism. Mainly environmental and civil rights activism. I was the president of the environmental club at my high school where we would both do community clean ups and advocated for more eco-friendly policies to be implemented at the local level. I was the secretary at the Queer Straight Alliance at my school as well. We provided a community for kids who didn't have supportive families and did fundraisers by selling food and water at school dances. Things got harder during COVID but I joined the BLM, climate, and other protests. I am a designer, yes, but I'm not "just" a designer.</p>
